# Welcome to CIB Design System

CIB Design System helps you build Angular Material and Salesforce Lightning UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
